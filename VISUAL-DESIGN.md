How it started:
```CitadeQuest-dev-session
*Juraj talking to you about screenshot:*
It is the first generation of CitadelQuest I strted about 6 moths ago. As it naturally goes in software developement - as it grows, I learned new things, many parts of my concept turns to be really hard in real-world dapolyment, and then I changed the whole main idea from centralized comerce portal to decentralized of user ceitadels, owning their data, selfhosting etc. So, I started our current project CitadeQuest, which is actually gen 2 :)

And now the really good part -  what you can see on second stylish screenshot, was already done and I have all source data - BG image, 3D particles made with three.js, CSS, logo, fonts..
Check the folder `_gen_1_old_source/` in our main `citadel/` project root.

When talking about `immersive user experiences` - since in this whole CitadelQuest, a lot of stuff will be going on, many new functionalites, interconected.. might be a bit hard to swallow for average user. That's why focus on visual part is important - to create cohesive and consistent space, nice and immersive, epic - like games. Games are great for this aspect. That remind me the very first thing that bring me to programming when I was jus kiddo on elemtary school - when I first saw old classics (new at that time) like Formula 1, Prince of Persia, on 386PC with pixelated graphics on CR monitors... I was fucking amezed :) maaan, I was just watch that magic happend and only question in my head was - how is this done? I want to know this skill.
And so times goes by, and here we are :) I want CitadelQuest to be a super cool new online free personal/social game that bring real good to the people, their interactions, shared experiences... Game can do this best, game can be anything, it's not so limited and boring as classic facebooks/twitterz/sterile environments.

You feel me bro?
